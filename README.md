# My Full-Stack Software Engineering Journey

Welcome to my personal documentation of the path I'm traversing to become a Full-Stack Software Engineer. This repository serves as a chronicle of my learning experiences, projects, and the invaluable resources I've encountered along the way.

## Introduction

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Communication and Technology at Durban University of Technology (DUT). My passion lies in algorithmic games, and I aspire to evolve into a proficient Software Engineer. This repository is a testament to my commitment to mastering both frontend and backend development skills.

## Resources Guiding My Journey

Throughout this endeavor, I've leveraged several key resources:

- **[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/):** A community-driven platform offering structured roadmaps and guides for developers.
  
- **[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/):** An extensive resource for web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
- **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/):** An AI conversational partner aiding in understanding complex topics and providing coding assistance.
  
- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/):** A vast repository of tutorials and lectures on various programming subjects.
  
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** A platform for version control and collaboration, hosting numerous open-source projects and code examples.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `projects/`: Contains all my coding projects, showcasing practical applications of my learning.
  
- `documents/`: A collection of my study notes, summaries, and key takeaways from various topics.
